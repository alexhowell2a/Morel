# Morel
More details and announcement coming soon.

Git repo will lay dormant for a while, but rest assured development is still underway behind the scenes. All of the branches are separate, and they're named after the codenames.
License will stay as MIT License until the announcement is made, after which it will be open-source, unless stated otherwise by that branch's LICENSE.
